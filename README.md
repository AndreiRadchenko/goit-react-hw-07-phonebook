# React-redux async operations

reduxjs/toolkit, mockapi.io (backend), createAsyncThunk

I created hook useShowLoader() and utilized it in Contact and ContactForm components for managing loaders. Hook create instanse for each component.
Also in this project I used react-spinners and react-highlight-words libraries.
